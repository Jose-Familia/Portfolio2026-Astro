      # Vercel deployment is handled automatically via Vercel GitHub integration
      # This workflow ensures tests pass before Vercel deploys
      #
      # To set up:
      # 1. Connect your repo to Vercel at https://vercel.com/new
      # 2. Vercel will auto-deploy on push to main
      # 3. This workflow acts as a gate - if tests fail, the commit is marked as failing
